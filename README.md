this was going to be my portfolio site because i wanted to learn some Go and htmx was really interesting, but I've been doing a lot of React at school/work recently so at the moment this project in on hiatus.

Go + htmx + tailwind

to run local dev environment, split terminal or open two terminal instances.

use "go run main.go" in one to run the app.
use "npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch" in the other to put tailwind into watch mode and compile new output stylesheets on the fly.
