# go-experiment
this was going to be my portfolio site because i wanted to learn some Go and htmx was really interesting, but I've been doing a lot of React at school/work recently so at the moment this project in on hiatus.

to run local dev environment, split terminal or open two terminal instances.

use "go run main.go" in one to run the app.
use "npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch" in the other to put tailwind into watch mode and compile new output stylesheets on the fly.
